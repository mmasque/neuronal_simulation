# neuronal_simulation

n_neuron.m is the most useful function. Documentation is in the file. 

For the moment, you'll need the Unix version of CSSR installed (with the executable accessible) if you want to use CSSR functionality. 


TODO:

* Change CSSR over to CSSR-Matlab so you don't need to worry about having the CSSR executable installed.
* Add KL divergence rate analysis functions.
* Probably move over to a class system in some point (in MatLab, how dare I!).
