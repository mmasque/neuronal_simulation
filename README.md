# neuronal_simulation

Right now, feature/n_neurons is the interesting, useful branch to take a look at. 

In particular, n_neuron.m is the most useful function. Documentation is in the file. 

For the moment, you'll need the Unix version installed (with the executable accessible) as my MatLab script is calling it.
