# neuronal_simulation

Right now, feature/n_neurons is the interesting, useful branch to take a look at. 

In particular, n_neuron.m is the most useful function. Documentation is in the file. 

I'm in the process of transitioning to Hao Hua's MatLab CSSR version, but right now you'll need the Unix version installed (with the executable accessible) as my MatLab script is calling it.
